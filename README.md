# Chip8_Emulator

This is a practice on building a Chip8-Emulator. The main focus of this was to build a funcitonal Chip8-Emulator using a funciton pointer table of arrays rather than a siwtch-case statements for the opcodes. 
The project uses an SDL library which would need to be downloaded prior running the program.


-- Another way to create a Chip8-Emulator is to use a giant switch-case for each of the opcodes.
